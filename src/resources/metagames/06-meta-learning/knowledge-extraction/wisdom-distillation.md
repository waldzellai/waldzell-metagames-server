# Wisdom Distillation

**Extract strategic principles from tactical implementations and transform experience into reusable frameworks through systematic analysis, validation, and knowledge synthesis.**

## Overview

Wisdom Distillation is a meta-learning framework that converts accumulated experience into actionable intelligence. It systematically analyzes historical decisions, extracts underlying principles, validates them across contexts, and packages them into reusable wisdom frameworks for future decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Multi-level abstraction**: Tactical → Strategic → Philosophical → Universal principles
- **Historical validation**: Test principles against past outcomes and decisions
- **Cross-domain synthesis**: Extract transferable insights across different contexts
- **Evolution tracking**: Monitor how principles change with new experience
- **Framework packaging**: Create actionable decision trees and mental models

## Usage

```bash
/wisdom-distillation [domain] [--timespan=PERIOD] [--abstraction=LEVEL] [--format=TYPE] [--validate-principles]
```

### Arguments

- `domain` (required): Technical domain or decision area (architecture, debugging, optimization, team-practices)
- `--timespan=PERIOD` (optional): Historical period to analyze (1month, 6months, 2years, all-time)
- `--abstraction=LEVEL` (optional): Principle abstraction level (tactical, strategic, philosophical, universal)
- `--format=TYPE` (optional): Output format (principles-catalog, decision-tree, mental-model, wisdom-framework)
- `--validate-principles` (optional): Test principles against historical outcomes

## Four-Phase Process

### Phase 1: Experience Inventory & Pattern Recognition
**Objective**: Catalog and analyze historical decisions and outcomes

**Activities**:
- **Decision Archaeology**: Identify major technical decisions and their contexts
- **Success Pattern Analysis**: Extract patterns from successful implementations
- **Failure Mode Examination**: Catalog failures and their root causes
- **Evolution Trajectory Mapping**: Track how approaches evolved over time

### Phase 2: Principle Extraction & Abstraction
**Objective**: Distill tactical experiences into strategic principles

**Activities**:
- **Pattern Abstraction**: Extract underlying principles from successful patterns
- **Meta-Principle Discovery**: Find principles that govern other principles
- **Context Boundary Analysis**: Define where principles apply and where they don't
- **Wisdom Hierarchy Construction**: Organize principles by abstraction level

### Phase 3: Validation & Refinement
**Objective**: Validate extracted principles against reality

**Activities**:
- **Historical Validation**: Test principles against past decisions and outcomes
- **Cross-Domain Validation**: Test principle applicability across different domains
- **Practical Application Testing**: Apply principles to current decision scenarios
- **Principle Evolution Management**: Track how principles change with new experience

### Phase 4: Wisdom Framework Creation
**Objective**: Package principles into actionable wisdom frameworks

**Activities**:
- **Decision Framework Construction**: Create structured approaches to common decisions
- **Mental Model Documentation**: Capture effective ways of thinking about problems
- **Principle Catalog Organization**: Organize principles by domain and application
- **Wisdom Integration Protocols**: Define how to apply multiple principles together

## Abstraction Levels

### Tactical Level
**Immediate, actionable guidance**:
- Code patterns and implementation approaches
- Debugging steps and troubleshooting procedures
- Tool usage and development environment practices
- Communication scripts and interaction patterns

### Strategic Level
**Medium-term planning and architecture**:
- System design and architectural principles
- Technology choice frameworks
- Team organization and collaboration structures
- Project management and delivery methodologies

### Philosophical Level
**Fundamental beliefs and values**:
- Quality philosophy and excellence standards
- Simplicity values and complexity management
- Growth mindset and capability development
- Ethical frameworks for responsible decisions

### Universal Level
**Principles that transcend software development**:
- Systems thinking and complex interactions
- Decision making under uncertainty
- Communication and understanding sharing
- Learning and continuous adaptation

## Distillation Strategies

### Bottom-Up Distillation
Starting from concrete implementations:
- **Implementation Analysis**: Extract patterns from working code
- **Architecture Archaeology**: Understand design decision rationale
- **Debugging Wisdom**: Distill effective troubleshooting approaches
- **Performance Insights**: Extract optimization principles and heuristics

### Top-Down Distillation
Starting from strategic outcomes:
- **Success Decomposition**: Break down successful projects into principles
- **Goal Achievement Analysis**: Understand effective strategy patterns
- **Leadership Insights**: Extract effective team and project management
- **Innovation Patterns**: Distill creative problem-solving approaches

### Cross-Cutting Distillation
Principles that span multiple domains:
- **Quality Philosophy**: What makes software truly excellent
- **Simplicity Principles**: How to manage and reduce complexity
- **Adaptability Frameworks**: How to build for change and evolution
- **Collaboration Wisdom**: How to enhance team effectiveness

## Anti-Patterns Prevented

### Knowledge Silos
**Symptoms**: Valuable insights trapped in individual experience
**Prevention**: Systematic extraction and documentation of tacit knowledge

### Repeated Mistakes
**Symptoms**: Teams making the same errors repeatedly
**Prevention**: Failure mode analysis and principle-based prevention strategies

### Shallow Learning
**Symptoms**: Learning tactics without understanding principles
**Prevention**: Multi-level abstraction ensures deep understanding

### Context Blindness
**Symptoms**: Applying solutions without understanding when they work
**Prevention**: Explicit context boundary analysis and conditional frameworks

### Wisdom Decay
**Symptoms**: Losing institutional knowledge when people leave
**Prevention**: Systematic capture and validation of organizational wisdom

## Example Usage

```bash
# Extract architectural wisdom from 2 years of decisions
/wisdom-distillation architecture --timespan=2years --abstraction=strategic --format=decision-tree --validate-principles

# Distill debugging philosophy from all historical experience
/wisdom-distillation debugging --timespan=all-time --abstraction=philosophical --format=mental-model

# Create tactical team practices catalog from recent experience
/wisdom-distillation team-practices --timespan=6months --abstraction=tactical --format=principles-catalog

# Generate universal decision-making framework
/wisdom-distillation decision-making --timespan=all-time --abstraction=universal --format=wisdom-framework
```

## Output Formats

### Principles Catalog
