# Complexity Navigator

Systematic approach to breaking down and managing complexity in large systems and unknown problem domains.

## Command Structure

```bash
/complexity-navigator "<complex_problem>" [--decomposition=<method>] [--depth=<levels>] [--strategy=<approach>] [--context=<domain>]
```

## Parameters

- `complex_problem`: Description of the complex problem to navigate
- `decomposition`: Decomposition method (hierarchical, functional, temporal, spatial)
- `depth`: Number of decomposition levels (1-5)
- `strategy`: Navigation strategy (divide-conquer, iterative, exploratory, systematic)
- `context`: Problem domain context (technical, business, research, design)

## Complexity Navigation Strategies

### Hierarchical Decomposition
- Break down problems into levels
- Identify parent-child relationships
- Manage dependencies between levels
- Optimize decomposition boundaries

### Functional Decomposition
- Separate concerns by function
- Identify core vs. peripheral functions
- Optimize functional boundaries
- Manage inter-functional dependencies

### Temporal Decomposition
- Break down problems by time phases
- Identify sequential dependencies
- Manage temporal constraints
- Optimize timeline execution

### Spatial Decomposition
- Separate concerns by location/scope
- Identify spatial relationships
- Manage distributed complexity
- Optimize spatial boundaries

## Navigation Approaches

### Divide and Conquer
- Recursively break down problems
- Solve subproblems independently
- Combine solutions effectively
- Manage integration complexity

### Iterative Refinement
- Start with simple solutions
- Incrementally add complexity
- Validate at each iteration
- Manage evolution carefully

### Exploratory Navigation
- Investigate unknown territories
- Map complexity landscape
- Identify key leverage points
- Adapt strategy based on findings

### Systematic Analysis
- Apply structured methodologies
- Use proven frameworks
- Follow established patterns
- Maintain consistency
