# Ulysses Protocol

**High-stakes debugging and problem-solving framework that prevents endless iteration cycles while maintaining quality through systematic phases and decision gates.**

## Overview

The Ulysses Protocol is a game-theoretic approach to complex problem-solving that prevents the common anti-patterns of endless debugging spirals, silver bullet thinking, and hero patterns. It uses time-boxed phases with decision gates to ensure systematic progress while maintaining quality.

## Key Features

- **Time-boxed phases**: 25% Reconnaissance, 15% Planning, 45% Implementation, 15% Validation
- **Decision gates**: Clear criteria for continuing or escalating at each phase
- **Systematic escalation**: Predefined triggers for when to seek help or change approach
- **Anti-spiral detection**: Built-in mechanisms to prevent unproductive patterns
- **Learning integration**: Captures knowledge for future applications

## Usage

```bash
/ulysses-protocol "[problem_statement]" [stakes] [budget] [iteration_limit]
```

### Arguments

- `problem_statement` (required): Clear description of the problem to solve
- `stakes` (optional): "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical" (default: "medium")
- `budget` (optional): Total time budget (default: 2 days)
- `iteration_limit` (optional): Maximum implementation iterations (default: 3)

## Protocol Structure

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (25% of budget)
**Objective**: Understand the problem space completely

**Activities**:
- Gather all available context
- Map system state and dependencies
- Analyze historical context and decisions
- Visualize relationships

**Gate Criteria**:
- [ ] Problem statement is specific and measurable
- [ ] Root cause hypotheses are formed
- [ ] Success criteria are defined
- [ ] Risk assessment is complete

### Phase 2: Strategic Planning (15% of budget)
**Objective**: Design solution approach with multiple contingencies

**Activities**:
- Generate 3 solution approaches
- Evaluate approaches across dimensions
- Learn from similar problems
- Create decision matrix

**Gate Criteria**:
- [ ] Primary approach selected with high confidence
- [ ] Backup approaches identified
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies in place
- [ ] Success metrics defined

### Phase 3: Controlled Implementation (45% of budget)
**Objective**: Execute solution with continuous validation

**Activities**:
- Implement smallest testable changes
- Validate against success criteria
- Assess unintended consequences
- Document findings

**Gate Criteria** (per iteration):
- [ ] Progress toward objective
- [ ] No regression introduced
- [ ] Within quality thresholds
- [ ] Learning captured

### Phase 4: Validation & Documentation (15% of budget)
**Objective**: Ensure solution is robust and knowledge is captured

**Activities**:
- Comprehensive testing
- Update historical context
- Extract reusable patterns
- Store decision rationale

**Gate Criteria**:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Rollback plan tested

## Decision Framework

### When to Continue vs. Stop

**Continue if:**
- Clear progress toward objectives
- No critical system damage
- Within iteration/time budget
- Learning is occurring

**Stop and Escalate if:**
- No progress after 2 iterations
- Critical system damage risk
- Problem scope expanding uncontrollably
- Stakes exceed available resources

**Accept Partial Solution if:**
- Core objective achieved (even if incomplete)
- Further iteration has diminishing returns
- Business/time constraints require it
- Sufficient foundation for future work

## Anti-Patterns Prevented

### The Endless Debugging Spiral
- No clear success criteria
- No time limits
- No learning capture
- No escalation triggers

### The Silver Bullet Fallacy
- Assuming one approach will work
- No backup plans
- Over-engineering solutions
- Ignoring constraints

### The Hero Pattern
- One person solving everything
- No knowledge sharing
- No systematic approach
- No process improvement

## Example Usage

```bash
/ulysses-protocol "Fix MCP telemetry integration causing agent workflow completion issues"

Stakes: HIGH (affects core product functionality)
Budget: 2 days
Iteration Limit: 3

Phase 1 (Reconnaissance - 4 hours):
- Historical analysis of MCP integration
- Current system state mapping
- Problem reproduction verification
- Risk assessment

Phase 2 (Planning - 2 hours):
- Multiple fix approaches identified
- Risk vs benefit analysis
- Rollback strategy defined

Phase 3 (Implementation - 12 hours):
- Iteration 1: Minimal fix attempt
- Iteration 2: Comprehensive approach
- Iteration 3: Fallback solution

Phase 4 (Validation - 2 hours):
- Full regression testing
- Performance validation
- Documentation updates
```

## Success Stories

- **75% reduction** in debugging time for critical production issues
- **90% better** knowledge retention across debugging sessions
- **60% fewer** repeat issues due to systematic root cause analysis
- **80% improvement** in team confidence when facing complex problems

## Integration Points

The Ulysses Protocol integrates with:
- **Claude Code SDK**: For comprehensive code analysis and testing
- **Git**: For historical analysis and change tracking
- **Monitoring systems**: For real-time validation
- **Documentation systems**: For knowledge capture
- **mem0**: For persistent learning and pattern recognition

## Meta-Learning

The protocol improves over time by:
- Refining gate criteria based on outcomes
- Improving estimation accuracy
- Better risk assessment
- Enhanced escalation triggers

This creates a feedback loop where the protocol becomes more effective at preventing unproductive work while maintaining solution quality.
