# Feature Discovery

**Generate diverse, high-quality feature implementations using game theory to escape the "first idea best idea" trap through cognitive explorers, diversity tournaments, and insight auctions.**

## Overview

Feature Discovery uses game-theoretic mechanisms to generate truly diverse implementation approaches for new features. It prevents groupthink, tunnel vision, and premature convergence through isolated exploration, cross-pollination auctions, and diversity rewards.

## Key Features

- **Cognitive explorers**: 6 specialized agents with distinct thinking styles and biases
- **Isolated generation**: Prevents groupthink through independent round-1 exploration
- **Insight auctions**: Second-price auctions for cross-pollination of ideas
- **Diversity tournaments**: Mathematical rewards for unique approaches
- **Constraint injection**: Random limitations force creative solutions
- **Prediction markets**: Multiple oracles evaluate final candidates

## Usage

```bash
/feature-discovery "[feature_request]" [max_rounds] [diversity_weight] [explorer_count]
```

### Arguments

- `feature_request` (required): Natural language description of the desired feature
- `max_rounds` (optional): Maximum discovery rounds before convergence (default: 3)
- `diversity_weight` (optional): How much to reward unique approaches 0-1 (default: 0.3)
- `explorer_count` (optional): Number of cognitive explorers (default: 6)

## Cognitive Explorers

### First Principles Explorer
- **Style**: Build from fundamental constraints
- **Strength**: Novel solutions from basic building blocks
- **Bias**: Over-engineering, ignoring practical constraints
- **Prompt**: "Starting only from technical constraints and capabilities..."

### Analogical Explorer
- **Style**: Find patterns from other domains
- **Strength**: Creative connections across fields
- **Bias**: Force-fitting metaphors inappropriately
- **Prompt**: "What successful patterns from other domains could inspire..."

### User Empathy Explorer
- **Style**: Start from user journey and emotions
- **Strength**: Actual user value and satisfaction
- **Bias**: Feature creep, emotional over-optimization
- **Prompt**: "Walking through the user's emotional journey..."

### Technical Elegance Explorer
- **Style**: Seek architectural beauty and code poetry
- **Strength**: Maintainable, beautiful design
- **Bias**: Ivory tower syndrome, over-abstraction
- **Prompt**: "If code were poetry and architecture were music..."

### Pragmatist Explorer
- **Style**: Ship it yesterday with existing tools
- **Strength**: Fast delivery and practical solutions
- **Bias**: Technical debt, shortcut taking
- **Prompt**: "You have 48 hours and existing tools..."

### Contrarian Explorer
- **Style**: Question all assumptions and conventional wisdom
- **Strength**: Hidden insights and alternative perspectives
- **Bias**: Analysis paralysis, destructive criticism
- **Prompt**: "Why might implementing this be the wrong approach..."

## Algorithm Phases

### Phase 1: Isolated Hypothesis Generation
Each explorer works independently to prevent groupthink:
- Generate approaches based on their cognitive style
- No communication between explorers
- Focus on their unique perspective and strengths
- Document approach, advantages, and weaknesses

### Phase 2: Cognitive Diversity Measurement
Calculate semantic distance between hypotheses:
- **Tunnel Vision Detection**: Average distance < 0.3 indicates convergence
- **Bikeshedding Detection**: Excessive focus on trivial details
- **Gold Plating Detection**: Average complexity > 0.8 indicates over-engineering

### Phase 3: Insight Auction (Cross-Pollination)
Second-price sealed-bid auction for insights:
- Each explorer bids on others' insights based on orthogonality
- Higher orthogonality (difference) = higher bid value
- Winners incorporate purchased insights into refined approaches
- Creates hybrid thinking and cross-domain pollination

### Phase 4: Constrained Innovation Round
Apply random constraints to force creative solutions:
- **Possible constraints**: no_external_dependencies, must_work_offline, accessibility_first, mobile_primary, zero_config, instant_rollback
- Each explorer adapts their approach to meet constraints
- Constraints often reveal new opportunities and creative solutions

### Phase 5: Diversity Tournament
Score hypotheses on quality AND uniqueness:
- **Base quality score**: How well it meets requirements (60-95%)
- **Diversity bonus**: Minimum distance to other hypotheses × diversity_weight
- **Final score**: Quality × (1 + diversity_bonus)
- Rewards being different while maintaining quality

### Phase 6: Hybrid Generation
Create hybrid solutions from top performers:
- Take top 3 approaches from diversity tournament
- Generate pairwise combinations
- Identify synergies and resolve conflicts
- Often produces better solutions than any individual approach

### Phase 7: Prediction Market
Multiple oracles evaluate final candidates:
- **Performance Oracle**: "Will it scale?"
- **User Satisfaction Oracle**: "Will users love it?"
- **Maintainability Oracle**: "Can we maintain it?"
- **Time to Market Oracle**: "Can we ship on time?"
- **Cost Oracle**: "Is it cost-effective?"

Each oracle provides prediction + confidence, creating market consensus.

## Anti-Patterns Prevented

### First Idea Best Idea
**Symptoms**: Taking the first reasonable approach without exploration
**Prevention**: Forced generation of multiple approaches before evaluation

### Groupthink
**Symptoms**: Team converging on similar solutions
**Prevention**: Isolated round-1 generation prevents influence

### Analysis Paralysis
**Symptoms**: Endless discussion without decision
**Prevention**: Forced constraint rounds and tournament scoring break deadlocks

### Feature Creep
**Symptoms**: Adding unnecessary complexity and features
**Prevention**: Prediction market grounds ideas in reality constraints

### Technical Tunnel Vision
**Symptoms**: Only considering technical implementation details
**Prevention**: Diversity tournament rewards unique perspectives across dimensions

## Game Theory Mechanisms

### Second-Price Auctions
- Explorers bid their true valuation of insights
- Winner pays second-highest bid
- Encourages truthful bidding and efficient allocation

### Diversity Bonuses
- Mathematical reward for being different
- Makes uniqueness financially advantageous
- Prevents convergence to local optima

### Prediction Markets
- Wisdom of crowds for final selection
- Multiple specialized oracles
- Confidence-weighted predictions

### Constraint Injection
- Random limitations force creativity
- Break assumption anchoring
- Reveal hidden opportunities

### Orthogonality Rewards
- Pay premium for truly different perspectives
- Measured by semantic distance
- Encourages cognitive diversity

## Example Usage
